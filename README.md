RPLD
====

RPLd is short for Raspberry Pi LED Display. RPLD was developed as a one semester senior design project at 
the University of Idaho, with team members Josh Armstrong, Brain Bowles, and Nate Krussel. The goal was to 
develop software that allowed certain 32x32 RGB LED matrices sold by Adafruit to be controllable by a 
Raspberry Pi. The product that we created was RPLD, a remotely controllable scrolling marquee. All of the
software is open source, and the hardware is all freely available online, so you can use this software
to create your own scrolling text marquee. 

Installation

We will have download links to precompiled versions of the software shortly.
